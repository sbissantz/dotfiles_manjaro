# Console login
# When using console-based login, the keyring daemon can be started by either
# PAM or xinitrc. PAM can also unlock the keyring automatically at login. 
#
# PAM method
# Start the gnome-keyring-daemon from /etc/pam.d/login:
# Add auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so at the end of the auth section and
# session optional pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start at the end of the session
# section.
#%PAM-1.0
#  
auth       required     pam_securetty.so
auth       requisite    pam_nologin.so
auth       include      system-local-login
auth       optional     pam_gnome_keyring.so ###
account    include      system-local-login
session    include      system-local-login
session    optional     pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start
 
# GDM: add password optional pam_gnome_keyring.so to the end of
# /etc/pam.d/passwd
#
#%PAM-1.0
# 
#password       required        pam_cracklib.so difok=2 minlen=8 dcredit=2 ocredit=2 retry=3
#password       required        pam_unix.so sha512 shadow use_authtok
password        required        pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok
password        optional        pam_gnome_keyring.os

# Note 1: To use automatic unlocking, the same password for the user account and
# the keyring have to be set.
# Note 2: You will still need the code in ~/.xinitrc below in order to export
# the environment variables required.
#
# Start the gnome-keyring-daemon from xinitrc: 
eval $(/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh)
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
#
# Terminal applications
# To enable the keyring for applications run through the terminal, such as SSH,
# add the following to your ~/.bash_profile
#
if [ -n "$DESKTOP_SESSION" ];then
    eval $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start)
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
fi

# gnome-keyring-daemon with the ssh component will start an SSH agent and
# automatically load all the keys matching ~/.ssh/id_* with corresponding .pub
# files. There is no way to remove these keys from the agent.
#
# List all loaded keys:
#
ssh-add -L

# To manually add an SSH key from another directory
#
ssh-add ~/.private/id_rsa
# Enter passphrase for ~/.private/id_rsa:

#To permanently save the a passphrase in the keyring, use ssh-askpass from
#package seahorse: 
#
/usr/lib/seahorse/ssh-askpass my_key

# Note: You have to have the corresponding .pub file in the same directory as
# the private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in the example). Also, make sure that the
# public key is the file name of the private key plus .pub (for example,
# my_key.pub).

# To disable all manually added keys:
#
ssh-add -D

# To delete the disabled key remove it from ~/.ssh/
#

#
# Git integration
#
# The GNOME keyring is useful in conjuction with Git when you are pushing over
# HTTPS.
pacman -Q libsecret
git config --global credential.helper /usr/lib/git-core/git-credential-libsecret
